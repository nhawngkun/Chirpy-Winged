How to Play: Chirpy-Winged 🎮🍰
Welcome to Chirpy-Winged, an exciting mobile arcade game where you collect cakes and deliver them to boxes while avoiding dangerous chefs!
🎯 Game Objective
Your mission is simple: collect as many cakes as possible and deliver them to the cake boxes scattered around the arena. But watch out - enemy chefs are constantly spawning and trying to stop you!
🕹️ Controls
Movement

Joystick (Left): Use the left joystick to move your character around the circular arena
Drag your finger on the joystick to walk in any direction
Release to stop moving immediately
Your character will automatically rotate to face the direction you're moving

Throwing Cakes

Joystick (Right): Use the right joystick to aim and throw cakes
When you're carrying a cake, an aim arrow and line will appear
Drag the right joystick in the direction you want to throw
Release the joystick to launch the cake toward the target
You can throw cakes at cake boxes to score points or at chefs to destroy them!

📦 Gameplay Mechanics
Collecting Cakes

Cakes spawn randomly around the arena with a glowing, rotating animation
Walk close to a cake (within pickup radius) to automatically collect it
When you pick up a cake, a visual model appears on your character's head
You can only carry one cake at a time

Delivering Cakes

Look for the cake boxes positioned around the arena
Walk into a cake box while carrying a cake to deposit it and score points
Alternatively, you can throw the cake into the box from a distance
Each successful delivery increases your score!

Enemy Chefs 👨‍🍳

Chefs spawn from designated entry points and move toward exit points
If a chef collides with you, you'll take damage and drop your cake
Chefs become more frequent and spawn faster as the game progresses
You have invincibility frames after taking damage (your character will pulse)

Combat System

Throw cakes at approaching chefs to destroy them before they reach you
A well-aimed throw can save you from taking damage
Destroyed chefs may drop additional cakes for you to collect

❤️ Health System

You start with 3 hearts (health points)
Each collision with a chef costs you 1 heart
After taking damage, you become temporarily invincible (indicated by a pulsing scale animation)
When you lose all hearts, it's game over!

🎮 Game Progression

Difficulty Scaling: As time passes, chefs spawn more frequently
The maximum number of active chefs increases gradually
The spawn interval between chefs decreases over time
Challenge yourself to survive as long as possible and achieve a high score!

🌟 Pro Tips

Stay Mobile: Keep moving to avoid chef collisions
Plan Your Route: Collect cakes strategically near cake boxes
Use Throws Wisely: Sometimes throwing is safer than walking to the box
Prioritize Survival: If surrounded by chefs, focus on dodging rather than delivering
Watch the Edges: You're confined to a circular boundary - don't get cornered!
Timing is Key: Use your invincibility frames wisely after taking damage
Clear Threats: Throw cakes at chefs when you're in danger
Combo Deliveries: Try to chain multiple cake deliveries quickly for efficiency

🏆 Scoring

Each cake successfully delivered to a box = +1 point
Your score is displayed at the top of the screen
